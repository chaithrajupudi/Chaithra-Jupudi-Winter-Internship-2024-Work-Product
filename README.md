# Chaithra-Jupudi-Winter-Internship-2024-Work-Product

This repository consists of the work I have done during my internship. As our team is customer facing, I have committed information and code that can be publicly exposed separately into this repository.

The repository contains two branches, each representing a distinct project I worked on:

- **buyer-app**: This branch includes Dart files for the application's UI and Node.js files for the APIs used.
  
- **mystore-landing-zone**: Here, you'll find code related to the deployment and infrastructure of the mystore application.
